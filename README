STANDARD DISCLAIMER: Unlike most people who commit code to github, my primary motivation is simply to find a place for interesting code to live if I don't want to lose track of it. You'll find my coding styles vary from project to project and that I pay little attention to community standards or feedback. I do all that stuff at my day job. Enjoy!

Sometimes, mainstream tools don't work and it's not a good idea to use popular scripts.  In that case,
it's good to have some standby scripts of your own to perform non-trivial tasks.  

The following PowerShell scripts assume that you have upload/execute capabilities on a target machine.

Http-Request 
  - Remote HTML/SOAP scraper
  - Make single-resource HTTP/HTTPS requests to an internal host.  Also works making SOAP calls.

Port-Query
  - Port-scanner
  - Basic functionality with adjustable delays.  Meant for stealth work, not network-raping.

Invoke-Expression 
  - Remote MSSQL queries
  - A great resource to use after capturing credentials and connection strings.
